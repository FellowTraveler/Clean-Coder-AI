## 📊 Why Clean Coder?

Our dream is to create a fully autonomous programmer one day, letting you relax (or at least do another job 😜) while your coding job will be done by AI.

That's why we care about making Clean Coder have top intelligence level and be equipped with most modern automation tools.

Learn more about Clean COder's idea [here](https://clean-coder.dev/faq/why_clean_coder/).

| Feature | Clean Coder | Cline | Aider | Cursor |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Intelligence** | ✅ Two-step Planer agent for thinking only  | 🟡 One-step plan mode | 🟡 One-step Architect agent | ❌ No thinking agent |
| **Codebase Research** | ✅ File descriptions RAG, codebase size independent | ❌ Simple file browsing approach only | 🟡 Repo map | 🟡 Also RAG, but not describes code before indexing  |
| **Project Management** | ✅ Full Todoist integration | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Frontend Visual testing** | ✅ Frontend Feedback agent | ✅ Webview | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **UI** | ❌ Terminal only | ✅ IDE | ✅ Webchat | ✅ IDE |


## ✨ Key advantages:

- Get project supervised by [Manager agent](https://clean-coder.dev/usage/manager/) with tasks organized in Todoist, just like with a human scrum master.
- Two-step planning module makes Clean Coder probably most intelligent [AI coder](https://clean-coder.dev/usage/programmer_pipeline/) available.
- [Semantic search (RAG)](https://clean-coder.dev/advanced_features_installation/similarity_search_for_researcher/) for effective navigating even large codebases.
- Allow AI to see frontend it creates with [frontend feedback feature](https://clean-coder.dev/features/frontend_feedback/). At the day of writing no other AI coder has that feature.
- Create a [frontend based on images](https://clean-coder.dev/features/working_with_images/) with designs.
- [Speak to Clean Coder](https://clean-coder.dev/features/talk_to_cc/) instead of writing.
- Automatic file linting prevents from introducing incorrect changes and [log check for self-debug](https://clean-coder.dev/advanced_features_installation/logs_check/).
- [Sensitive files protection](https://clean-coder.dev/features/sensitive_file_protection/) from being watched by AI.
