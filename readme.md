## ‚ú® Key advantages:

- Get project supervised by [Manager agent](https://clean-coder.dev/quick_start/manager/) with thoroughly-described tasks organized in Todoist, just like with a human scrum master.
- Watch tasks executed one by one by [Programming agents](https://clean-coder.dev/quick_start/programmer_pipeline/), with a well-designed context pipeline and advanced techniques for enhanced intelligence.
- Create a [frontend based on images](https://clean-coder.dev/features/working_with_images/) with designs.
- [Speak to Clean Coder](https://clean-coder.dev/features/talk_to_cc/) instead of writing.
- Automatic file linting prevents from introducing incorrect changes and [log check for self-debug](https://clean-coder.dev/advanced_features_installation/logs_check/).
- File Researcher agent with (but not only) [RAG tool](https://clean-coder.dev/advanced_features_installation/similarity_search_for_researcher/) for effective searching of project files.
