## üèñÔ∏è Relax and watch it code

```
git clone https://github.com/GregorD1A1/Clean-Coder-AI
cd Clean-Coder-AI

pip install -r requirements.txt

python single_task_coder.py
```
or (recommended) check detailed instructions [how to start in documentation](https://clean-coder.dev/quick_start/programmer_pipeline/).

You can also [deploy with Docker](https://clean-coder.dev/quick_start/run_with_docker/).


## ‚ú® Key advantages:

- Get project supervised by [Manager agent](https://clean-coder.dev/quick_start/manager/) with thoroughly-described tasks organized in Todoist, just like with a human scrum master.
- Watch tasks executed one by one by [Programming agents](https://clean-coder.dev/quick_start/programmer_pipeline/), with a well-designed context pipeline and advanced techniques for enhanced intelligence.
- Allow AI to see fronted it creates using [frontend feedback feature](https://clean-coder.dev/features/frontend_feedback/). At the day of writing no other AI coder has that.
- Create a [frontend based on images](https://clean-coder.dev/features/working_with_images/) with designs.
- [Speak to Clean Coder](https://clean-coder.dev/features/talk_to_cc/) instead of writing.
- Automatic file linting prevents from introducing incorrect changes and [log check for self-debug](https://clean-coder.dev/advanced_features_installation/logs_check/).
- File Researcher agent with (but not only) [RAG tool](https://clean-coder.dev/advanced_features_installation/similarity_search_for_researcher/) for effective searching of project files.
- [Sensitive files protection](https://clean-coder.dev/features/sensitive_file_protection/) from being watched by AI.
